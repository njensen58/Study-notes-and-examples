# Redux
  * Since context and useReducer are solid, you may never need this, but its good to know as its everywhere.
  * One reason you may use them is to do something like handle 10 async api requests in a synchronous manner in a 
    specific order using redux `sagas.`

  
  * Need to install:
    * `npm i redux react-redux`

  # Setup
    * Make a `store.js`
      * See file for needed setup code.
